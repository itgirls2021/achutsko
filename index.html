            <h1>Lexie Hutsko's Biography</h1>

            <h2>Personal Information</h2>

            <p><Hello, my name is <strong>Lexie Hutsko</strong> and I am going to be a sophmore in highschool. I live in Naperville, IL which is very close to Chicago. I decided to take this class because it sounded very fun and I have not learned any of the information I will in this class in school. I don't have any specific interests in technology I just find everything about it interesting. I like to swim, draw and read in my free time. I also like to play with my dogs.
