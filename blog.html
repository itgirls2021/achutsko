                The video that is right below this is my favorite video on using HTML. If you are new to using HTML, don't worry, this one is very easy to understand for beginners. Have fun watching!<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qz0aGYrrlhU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <h2>Positves of Cryptography</h2>

                There are a few ways in which I have been impacted by cryptography. The first is that it keeps my information private. Without cryptography, myself and my other’s data would be much easier to access if a random person wanted it. Cryptography overall makes me feel more safe because my data is secure.

                Personally, I think cryptography is a positive thing. One reason why that is is because it keeps information safe and secure. So, if anyone is trying to steal someone else’s information the chances of that happening are much more slim. Only the person who the information belongs to can access it which creates more privacy.

                Let's say that someone is trying to steal the information for my blog post to use for another blog, oh no! Luckily, cryptography exists which can prevent that person from stealing my information. That means the chances of keeping the information that will be on my post to myself is higher.

                Sometimes when I am watching a video, there is another video that the website recommends. This is an example of machine learning. Unfortunately, sometimes these recommendations are of videos I don’t want to watch. I do not consider that unfair, that is just what machine learning is, trial and error.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet again, I do not consider machine learning to be unfair. Sometimes the video recommendation is wrong, but that is just how it learns to accommodate someone’s needs in a more efficient way.
