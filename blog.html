                There are a few ways in which I have been impacted by cryptography. The first is that it keeps my information private. Without cryptography, myself and my other’s data would be much easier to access if a random person wanted it. Cryptography overall makes me feel more safe because my data is secure.

                Personally, I think cryptography is a positive thing. One reason why that is is because it keeps information safe and secure. So, if anyone is trying to steal someone else’s information the chances of that happening are much more slim. Only the person who the information belongs to can access it which creates more privacy.

                Let's say that someone is trying to steal the information for my blog post to use for another blog, oh no! Luckily, cryptography exists which can prevent that person from stealing my information. That means the chances of keeping the information that will be on my post to myself is higher.
