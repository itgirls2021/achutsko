                The video that is right below this is my favorite video on using HTML. If you are new to using HTML, don't worry, this one is very easy to understand for beginners. Have fun watching!<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qz0aGYrrlhU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <h2>Positves of Cryptography</h2>
            <p>By: Lexie Hutsko / Date of Post: July 22, 2021</p>

                There are a few ways in which I have been impacted by cryptography. The first is that it keeps my information private. Without cryptography, myself and my other’s data would be much easier to access if a random person wanted it. Cryptography overall makes me feel more safe because my data is secure.

                Personally, I think cryptography is a positive thing. One reason why that is is because it keeps information safe and secure. So, if anyone is trying to steal someone else’s information the chances of that happening are much more slim. Only the person who the information belongs to can access it which creates more privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's say that someone is trying to steal the information for my blog post to use for another blog, oh no! Luckily, cryptography exists which can prevent that person from stealing my information. That means the chances of keeping the information that will be on my post to myself is higher.

                Sometimes when I am watching a video, there is another video that the website recommends. This is an example of machine learning. Unfortunately, sometimes these recommendations are of videos I don’t want to watch. I do not consider that unfair, that is just what machine learning is, trial and error.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet again, I do not consider machine learning to be unfair. Sometimes the video recommendation is wrong, but that is just how it learns to accommodate someone’s needs in a more efficient way.

                Last week in class, we had an assignment where we had to create a game based off of a another game. The point of the game being created is to solve a problem. The whole class was put into three groups. I was in group 2. Our game had to be based off of Animal Crossings. Our assignment was for a non-profit that wanted to show how income inequality can impact students ability to learn in school. My group and I had so many ideas, so it was hard for us to come up with a game in such little time. But, we took a few of those ideas and put them into one. Again, we were short on time so our company name was very simple, MTSLD(all of our initials combined). How the game works is that you can earn money as a student by getting a job and have to go through the everyday life of that student. Once you raise enough money, you can buy all sorts of different skins and live the life of different students lives. Many things that make all the kids differ is wether their paerents have a well paying job, location, what school they go to, gender, age(everyone is in some year in highschool), etc... We had so many ideas and were very rushed, but that is what my group and I came up with.
